# Codeforces-Crawler #
It is a Django based website that scrapes information from Codeforces website using Beautiful Soup. It uses PostgreSQL as the backend database. The following are the key features of this project:
* User registration, login, and logout.
* Get contest details of upcoming contests. 
* Get the leaderboard for coders from my college, Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati.
* Get information about a user like their name, rating, collegeâ€™s name, color, title etc.
* Get information about stats of the submissions made by a user like languages used, verdicts and the level of problem attempted. It also shows them pictorially, pie charts for languages and verdicts and bar graph for levels of problem.
* Chat among users with all the message history getting saved in the database.


## Tech Stack ##
* Frontend: HTML/CSS
* Backend: Django
* Database : PostgreSQL

## How to run locally? ##
* Clone the repo:
    * git clone https://github.com/sakshi-s/Codeforces-Crawler.git
* Create virtual environment:
    * python -m venv env
    * env\Scripts\activate
This will create env folder.
* Change Directory:
    * cd Codeforces-Crawler
* Install dependencies using : 
    * pip install -r requirements.txt
* Change Directory:
    * cd CodeforcesCrawler
* Update the password for your 'postgres' superuser in settings.py. Then make migrations using
    * python manage.py makemigrations
* Migrate Database
    * python manage.py migrate
* Create a superuser
    * python manage.py createsuperuser
* Run server using
    * python manage.py runserver
    * Server starts at 'http://127.0.0.1:8000/'

## Future plans ##
* Get information for other coding platforms like CodeChef, Leetcode etc.
* Explore some APIs that may be present for these purposes as scraping tends to be slow.
* Use Multiprocessing Pool python library to improve speed.
* Implement Google, Outlook or GitHub account based authentication.
